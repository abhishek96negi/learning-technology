    "## What is GraphQL ?\n",
    "\n",
    "* new **API** standard that was invented & open-sourced by facebook.\n",
    "* enables **declarative data fetching**\n",
    "* GraphQL server exposes a **single endpoint** and responds to **queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. Now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GraphQL - A Query Language for APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most applications today have the need to fetch data from a server where that data is stored in a database. It’s the responsibility of the API to provide an interface to the stored data that fits an application’s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is often confused with being a database technology. This is a misconception, GraphQL is a query language for APIs - not databases. In that sense it’s database agnostic and effectively can be used in any context where an API is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![graphQL1](../image/GraphQL/graphQL1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## A more efficient Alternative to REST\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increased mobile usage creates need for efficient data loading**:\n",
    "Increased mobile usage, low-powered devices and sloppy networks were the initial reasons why Facebook developed GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variety of different frontend frameworks and platforms**:\n",
    "The heterogeneous landscape of frontend frameworks and platforms that run client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access precisely the data it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fast development & expectation for rapid feature development**:\n",
    "Continuous deployment has become a standard for many companies, rapid iterations and frequent product updates are indispensable. With REST APIs, the way data is exposed by the server often needs to be modified to account for specific requirements and design changes on the client-side. This hinders fast development practices and product iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A rapidly growing Community**\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, GraphQL is a technology that can be used everywhere a client communicates with an API. Interestingly, other companies like Netflix or Coursera were working on comparable ideas to make API interactions more efficient. Coursera envisioned a similar technology to let a client specify its data requirements and Netflix even open-sourced their solution called Falcor. After GraphQL was open-sourced, Coursera completely cancelled their own efforts and hopped on the GraphQL train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, GraphQL is used in production by lots of different companies such as GitHub, Twitter, Yelp and Shopify - to name only a few.\n",

    "## GraphQL vs REST\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Great ideas in REST**: stateless servers & structured access to resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **REST is a strict specification**: but the concept was widely interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rapidly **changing requirements on client-side** don't go well with the static nature of REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL was developed to cope with the **need for more flexibility and efficiency** in client-server communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Fetching with REST vs GraphQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST API**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a REST API, you would typically gather the data by accessing multiple endpoints. In the example, these could be `/users/<id>` endpoint to fetch the initial user data. Secondly, there’s likely to be a `/users/<id>/posts` endpoint that returns all the posts for a user. The third endpoint will then be the `/users/<id>/followers` that returns a list of followers per user.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL3](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    With REST, you have to make three requests to different endpoints to fetch the required data. You’re also overfetching since the endpoints return additional information that’s not needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**GraphQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "you’d simply send a single query to the GraphQL server that includes the concrete data requirements. The server then responds with a JSON object where these requirements are fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL4](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using GraphQL, the client can specify exactly the data it needs in a query. Notice that the structure of the server’s response follows precisely the nested structure defined in the query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## No more Overfetching and Underfetching\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfetching**: Downloading unnecessary data.\n",
    "* **Underfetching**: An endpoint doesn't return enough of the right information; need to send multiple requests (n+1-requests problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Schema & Types\n",

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Schema Definition Language (SDL)\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL has its own type system that’s used to define the schema of an API. The syntax for writing schemas is called Schema Definition Language (SDL).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining simple types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we can use the SDL to define a simple type called `Person`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    type Person {\n",
    "      name: String!\n",
    "      age: Int!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "This type has two fields, they’re called `name` and `age` and are respectively of type `String` and `Int`. The `!` following the type means that this field is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also possible to express relationships between types. In the example of a blogging application, a `Person` could be associated with a `Post`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    type Post {\n",
    "      title: String!\n",
    "      author: Person!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "Conversely, the other end of the relationship needs to be placed on the `Person` type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Person {\n",
    "      name: String!\n",
    "      age: Int!\n",
    "      posts: [Post!]!\n",
    "    }    \n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL5](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we just created a one-to-many-relationship between `Person` and `Post` since the posts field on `Person` is actually an array of posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetching Data with Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL6](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with REST APIs, data is loaded from specific endpoints. Each endpoint has a clearly defined structure of the information that it returns. This means that the data requirements of a client are effectively encoded in the URL that it connects to.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL7](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that’s taken in GraphQL is radically different. Instead of having multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, GraphQL APIs typically only expose a single endpoint. This works because the structure of the data that’s returned is not fixed. Instead, it’s completely flexible and lets the client decide what data is actually needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the client needs to send more information to the server to express its data needs - this information is called a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at an example query that a client could send to a server:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        allPersons {\n",
    "            name\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "The `allPersons` field in this query is called the root field of the query. Everything that follows the root field, is called the payload of the query. The only field that’s specified in this query’s payload is `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This query would return a list of all persons currently stored in the database. Here’s an example response:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"allPersons\": [\n",
    "            { \"name\": \"Johnny\" },\n",
    "            { \"name\": \"Sarah\" },\n",
    "            { \"name\": \"Alice\" }\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  \n",
    "Notice that each person only has the `name` in the response, but the `age` is not returned by the server. That’s exactly because `name` was the only field that was specified in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the client also needed the persons’ `age`, all it has to do is slightly adjust the query and include the new field in the query’s payload:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      allPersons {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "        age\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "One of the major advantages of GraphQL is that it allows for naturally querying nested information. For example, if you wanted to load all the `posts` that a `Person` has written, you could simply follow the structure of your types to request this information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      allPersons {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "        age\n",
    "        posts {\n",
    "          title\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Queries with Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "In GraphQL, each field can have zero or more arguments if that’s specified in the schema. For example, the `allPersons` field could have a `last` parameter to only return up to a specific number of persons. Here’s what a corresponding query would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      allPersons(last: 2) {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Writing Data with Mutations   \n",
    "\n",
    "Next to requesting information from a server, the majority of applications also need some way of making changes to the data that’s currently stored in the backend. With GraphQL, these changes are made using so-called mutations. There generally are three kinds of mutations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* creating new data\n",
    "* updating existing data\n",
    "* deleting existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations follow the same syntactical structure as queries, but they always need to start with the `mutation` keyword. Here’s an example for how we might create a new `Person`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mutation {\n",
    "      createPerson(name: \"Bob\", age: 36) {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "        age\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that similar to the query we wrote before, the mutation also has a root field - in this case it’s called `createPerson`. We also already learned about the concepts of arguments for fields. In this case, the `createPerson` field takes two arguments that specify the new person’s `name` and `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with a query, we’re also able to specify a payload for a mutation in which we can ask for different properties of the new `Person` object. In our case, we’re asking for the `name` and the `age` - though admittedly that’s not super helpful in our example since we obviously already know them as we pass them into the mutation. However, being able to also query information when sending mutations can be a very powerful tool that allows you to retrieve new information from the server in a single roundtrip!\n",
    "\n",
    "The server response for the above mutation would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"createPerson\": {\n",
    "      \"name\": \"Bob\",\n",
    "      \"age\": 36,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "One pattern you’ll often find is that GraphQL types have unique IDs that are generated by the server when new objects are created. Extending our `Person` type from before, we could add an `id` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Person {\n",
    "      id: ID!\n",
    "      name: String!\n",
    "      age: Int!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "Now, when a new `Person` is created, you could directly ask for the `id` in the payload of the mutation, since that is information that wasn’t available on the client beforehand:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    mutation {\n",
    "      createPerson(name: \"Alice\", age: 36) {\n",
    "        id\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Realtime Updates with Subscriptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important requirement for many applications today is to have a realtime connection to the server in order to get immediately informed about important events. For this use case, GraphQL offers the concept of subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client subscribes to an event, it will initiate and hold a steady connection to the server. Whenever that particular event then actually happens, the server pushes the corresponding data to the client. Unlike queries and mutations that follow a typical “request-response-cycle”, subscriptions represent a stream of data sent over to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscriptions are written using the same syntax as queries and mutations. Here’s an example where we subscribe on events happening on the `Person` type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    subscription {\n",
    "      newPerson {\n",
    "        name\n",
    "        age\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "After a client sent this subscription to a server, a connection is opened between them. Then, whenever a new mutation is performed that creates a new `Person`, the server sends the information about this person over to the client:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"newPerson\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Jane\",\n",
    "        \"age\": 23\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### The GraphQL Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "* defines capabilities of the API by specifying how a client and fetch and update data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* represents contract between client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "* collection of GraphQL types with special root types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        type Query { ... }\n",
    "        type Mutation { ... }\n",
    "        type Subscription { ... }\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "The `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` types are the entry points for the requests sent by the client. To enable the `allPersons`-query that we saw before, the `Query` type would have to be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Query {\n",
    "      allPersons: [Person!]!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "`allPersons` is called a root field of the API. Considering again the example where we added the `last` argument to the `allPersons` field, we’d have to write the `Query` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Query {\n",
    "      allPersons(last: Int): [Person!]!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "Similarly, for the `createPerson`-mutation, we’ll have to add a root field to the `Mutation` type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Mutation {\n",
    "      createPerson(name: String!, age: Int!): Person!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that this root field takes two arguments as well, the `name` and the `age` of the new `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the subscriptions, we’d have to add the `newPerson` root field:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Subscription {\n",
    "      newPerson: Person!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, this is the full schema for all the queries and mutation that you have seen in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Query {\n",
    "      allPersons(last: Int): [Person!]!\n",
    "      allPosts(last: Int): [Post!]!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Mutation {\n",
    "      createPerson(name: String!, age: Int!): Person!\n",
    "      updatePerson(id: ID!, name: String!, age: String!): Person!\n",
    "      deletePerson(id: ID!): Person!\n",

    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL has been released only as a specification. This means that GraphQL is in fact not more than a long document that describes in detail the behaviour of a GraphQL server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GraphQL server with a connected database**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* often used for greenfield projects\n",
    "* uses single web server that implements GraphQL\n",
    "* server resolves queries and constructed responses with data that it fetches from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that GraphQL is actually transport-layer agnostic. This means it can potentially be used with any available network protocol. So, it is potentially possible to implement a GraphQL server based on TCP, WebSockets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL also doesn’t care about the database or the format that is used to store the data. You could use a SQL database like AWS Aurora or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL8](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard greenfield architecture with one GraphQL server that connects to a single database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **GraphQL layer that integrates existing systems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* compelling use case for companies with legacy infrastructures and many different APIs.\n",
    "* GraphQL can be used to unify existing systems and hide complexity of data fetching logic.\n",
    "* the server doesn't care about what the data sources are (databases, web services, 3rd party APIs,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL9](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL allows you to hide the complexity of existing systems, such as microservices, legacy infrastructures or third-party APIs behind a single GraphQL interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid approach with connected database and integration of existing system**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it’s possible to combine the two approaches and build a GraphQL server that has a connected database but still talks to legacy or third—party systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a query is received by the server, it will resolve it and either retrieve the required data from the connected database or some of the integrated APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL10](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches can also be combined and the GraphQL server can fetch data from a single database as well as from an existing system - allowing for complete flexibility and pushing all data management complexity to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolver Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* GraphQL queries/mutations consist of a set of fields.\n",
    "* GraphQL server has one resolver function per field.\n",
    "* the purpose of each resolver is to retrieve the data for its corresponding field.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GraphQL11](../image/GraphQL/GraphQL11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above screenshot contains some of the resolved field names. Each field in the query corresponds to a resolver function. The GraphQL calls all required resolvers when a query comes in to fetch the specified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GraphQL Client Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* GraphQL is great for frontend developers as data fetching complexity can be pushed to the server-side.\n",
    "* Client doesn't care where data is coming from\n",
    "* opportunity for new abstractions on the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From imperative to declarative data fetching\n",
    "\n",
    "**imperative data fetching**\n",
    "1. construct and send HTTP request (e.g. with fetch in Javascript)\n",
    "2. receive and parse server response\n",
    "3. store data locally (either simply in memory or persistent)\n",
