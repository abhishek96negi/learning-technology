    "### Type of Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One to one** :- one publisher one subscriber.\n",
    "* **One to many** :- one publisher many subscribers.\n",
    "* **Many to one** :- many publishers one subscriber.\n",

    "* **Publisher** :- Publisher is an application or service that sends messages.\n",
    "* **Subscriber** :- Subscriber is an application or service that receives messages.\n",
    "* **Channel** :- Channel is the subject or the information feed. The publisher can push messages to the channel, which will broadcast messages to the subscribers.\n",
    "* **Message** :- Message holds the received or transmitted data throughout the system.\n",
    "* **Broker** :- Broker is responsible for guiding the messages throughout the system. It acts as a middleman to establish and exchange commuincation between the publisher and subscriber."
